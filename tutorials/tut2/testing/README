Welcome to the testing example!

1. In check.h, there are the descriptions of 8 test programs. Each one has
a "Claim", claiming what the program does. There are 4 CORRECT claims and 4
INCORRECT claims. Your job is to create test cases to see which ones are
CORRECT and which ones are INCORRECT.

2. The executable is called test. See the PDF for how to use it.

3. The answers are in answers.txt.
